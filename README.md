Well, these mice are in a very terrible position truly. 

Science must go on. Cake and all that.

So, we almost got an even split here sex wise 51% Male and 49% Female and in clinical studies sex matters. Outside of that who cares. Oddly, before we get into what works best. Seems to be a strong connection between the size of a tumor and size of the mouse. Yes, heavier the mouse the bigger the tumor. In general, for the size of a species I supposes there is logic there. But it was an odd finding for me. Tumors are not necessary dietary maybe method of how “Science” delivered the tumors plays a part?  These things are all within reach of each other but clearly the heavier mouse show a bigger tumor. 

Moveing on for the drugs in the clinical study Capomulin and Ramican are our winners for decreeing the size of tumors. Capomulin buy a hair also though they had few more males. I can't show Male mouse performed better in this trail, but I can show better preforming drug out of the top two had more males. However, it should be noted, no drug was immune to outliers. Ceftamin was the most radical for outliers. but while radical with outliers Ceftamin will not be the lowest preforming drug. No Infubinol will be. Infubinol at least consistent in it results shows to shrink tumors the least, killing more mice! If that is your goal. If it is to find a drugs to shrink tumors might I suggest Capomulin or Ramican.

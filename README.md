Well, these mice are in a very terrible position truly. 

Science must go on. Cake and all that.

So, we almost got an even split here sex wise 51% Male and 49% Female and in clinical studies sex matters. Outside of that who cares. Oddly, before we get into what works best. Seems to be a strong connection between the size of a tumor and size of the mouse. Yes, heavier the mouse the bigger the tumor. In general, for the size of a species I supposes there is logic there. But it was an odd finding for me. Tumors are not necessary dietary maybe method of how “Science” delivered the tumors plays a part?  These things are all within reach of each other but clearly the heavier mouse show a bigger tumor. Capomulin and Ramican are our winners for decreeing the size of tumors however not immune to outliers. Ceftamin being the most radical for outliers with Infubinol being the lowest preforming drug.
